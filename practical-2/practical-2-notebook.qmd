## Instructions for practical 2

Follow the instructions online at:\
[david-barnett.github.io/MSP-microbiome-workshop/web/practical2-instructions.html](https://david-barnett.github.io/MSP-microbiome-workshop/web/practical2-instructions.html)

For practical 2, you will need to fill out this notebook by copying and modifying the instruction material.

Remember you can add code chunks with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`I` (Windows) or `Cmd`+`Option`+`I` (Mac).

Remember to take your time to understand each step. Don't rush to the end, there is no prize for completion!
